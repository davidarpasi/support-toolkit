# Support Engineer Toolkit

A practical, no-nonsense toolkit built from 10+ years of real-world IT Support experience.  
Includes PowerShell scripts for diagnostics and cleanup, plus step-by-step guides for common L1/L2 issues.

## What's Inside

### PowerShell Scripts (`/powershell-scripts`)
- `get-network-info.ps1`  
  Collects key network configuration data: IP, adapters, routing table, ping, and DNS resolution.

More scripts coming soon (flush DNS, clear temp, collect logs).

### Troubleshooting Guides (`/troubleshooting-guides`)
Work-in-progress guides for common support issues:
- VPN not connecting
- Printer offline
- Outlook not syncing
- WiFi connection drops

## Who is this for?

- L1–L2 Support Engineers
- Remote troubleshooting teams
- Cybersecurity-adjacent support roles
- Anyone who solves technical issues under pressure

## Why I built this

To consolidate proven support practices into shareable, reusable tools — and show I don’t just solve tickets, I systematize solutions.
